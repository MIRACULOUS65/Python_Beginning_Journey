# This code performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers a and b

print(a + b)  # This will print the sum of a and b
print(a - b)  # This will print the difference of a and b
print(a * b)  # This will print the product of a and b  
print(a / b)  # This will print the quotient of a and b
print(a // b)  # This will print the floor division of a and b
print(a % b)  # This will print the remainder of a divided by b
print(a ** b)  # This will print a raised to the power of b

#comparison operators
print(a == b)  # This will check if a is equal to b
print(a != b)  # This will check if a is not equal to b
print(a > b)   # This will check if a is greater than b
print(a < b)   # This will check if a is less than b
print(a >= b)  # This will check if a is greater than or equal to b
print(a <= b)  # This will check if a is less than or equal to b
print(a and b)  # This will return b if a is truthy, otherwise it returns a
print(a or b)   # This will return a if a is truthy, otherwise it returns b
print(not a)   # This will return True if a is falsy, otherwise it returns False
print(a is b)  # This will check if a and b are the same object
print(a is not b)  # This will check if a and b are not the same object
